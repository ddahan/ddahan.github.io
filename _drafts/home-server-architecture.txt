Today, I'd like to share my own home server architecture and then explain the choices I made. Before that, maybe we should clarify the "Architecture" term. As you know (or maybe not), an IT system can be seen from different points of view. Each of them bring different pieces of information. Depending on what you want to know/do, all these views can be interesting to you. Let's describe the 3 types of architecture :
<h4>Technical Architecture</h4>
Technical architecture refers to the hardware used in your system. When you're thinking of technical architecture, you should answer these questions: what is the hardware used to make my IT system run? How these blocs are plugged together? This is indeed a simplification, but technical architecture can actually be drawn just by seeing the reality.

For example, "a HP Micro Server" can be linked to a "Cisco Switch" using an "Ethernet Cable". All these stuff are physical, you can touch them, they compose the infrastructure of your IT system.
<h4>Logical/Software Architecture</h4>
I could be hit for mixing logical and software architecture, but let's try to simplify it, saying that it's about the soft part running on the infrastructure we described above.

If your computer is the hardware part (technical architecture), what is running on your computer ? An operational system (Windows, OSX, Linux...), and what is running above your Operational system ? Software like your favorite web Browser, Word, Photoshop, World Of Warcraft, etc. Again, it's simplified, but we don't mind here. Just see L/S Architecture as logical blocs that can be next to each other, or embedded like Russian dolls (the OS contains the software)
<h4>Functional Architecture</h4>
Function architecture identifies what <strong>functions</strong> are available and how they interact together. When you're thinking of functional architecture, you must have a user view here and answer this question: what can the user do in the system? There is here absolutely no technical reference.

For example, "send a file", "convert file format", "read a file" are 3 functions that the user of our IT system could use.

Now this "introduction" is finished, let draw and describe (pictures and words !) the architecture<strong>s</strong> of my home server.
