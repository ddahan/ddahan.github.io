Programming seems to be an underrated job, especially in France. In this post, from my own experience, I'll try to explain why.

<h3><b>A strange way of thinking</b></h3>
My French engineering school was specialized in programming so I had to work on lots of team programming projects in languages like C, C++, Java, Caml, etc. We used to work at night and all weekends.

Yet, many people around me, including teachers, said sentences like this during all my school time:

- "Be careful, if you stay too long in a technical area, you will never get out of it!"

- "Start with coding, it's OK, then you'll evolve towards a project manager job..."

- "You should outsource all your coding tasks to Chinese or Indian people."

These sentences reveal how some French people think: coding is just something than anyone can do, with no added value. According to these people, if you want a respectable career (the one your parents would be proud of), the only way to get it  is to get out of technical shit and get responsibilities by managing other people. On top of that, telling "I'm a programmer" to a pretty girl is a good way to make her run away (but this is another topic).

In the meantime, in spite of all of this, I still liked technical stuff (why wouldn't I, since I had made the choice to become an Engineer?)

So, being unable at this stage to distinguish what was true or wrong, and what I should do to ensure a good future, I decided that it would be a good compromise to have a general knowledge of IT and not stay stuck in area to specialized. I became an IT consultant in a respectable French Company. I told myself : "This way, you stay in the technical world you like, but you’re not too bogged down in a geeky job, with the possibility to move into a better position, because everyone tells you to do so".
<h3><b>Project Manager VS Developer?</b></h3>
The truth is, in 2 years, I made lots of different things, as I had expected, and I even had the role of a project manager: I managed a man who was older than me to develop some internal software.

Here is what I’ve learned from this experience:

- Managing an IT project (even if this project is software development) should not be compared to developing software, the roles are completely different!

- It's neither easier nor harder: developing a simple script is easier than designing a full multi-replicated software architecture. Managing a  two-person team for a project is easier than being at the head of a strategical project involving lots of complicated political aspects.

On the one hand, someone masters algorithms, programming languages, software architectures, and is constantly thinking of the best way to solve a problem.

On the other hand, someone manages budgets, deadlines, human relationships, sends emails, creates reports, makes presentations.

Tell me why people want to create a hierarchical relationship between them? It's a complete nonsense and can lead to ridiculous and frustrating situations in which project managers are unable to understand code, set improbable deadlines to developers, and say "well done" to something easy but don't congratulate awesome work.

This kind of behaviour makes the actually good French developers flee to the United States, where founders know how to attract them, and how to keep them. The income of a French developer is ludicrously low compared to that of someone working in the Silicon Valley. This fact, among others, shows the inability of many French companies to see the value of a good developer. Managers use <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/dan_pink_on_motivation.html">the intrinsic motivation</a> rather than a stick, providing a nice environment, making developers work on projects they actually enjoy, leaving them time to work on their personal projects, etc.
<h3><b>Why I decided to quit my consulting job</b></h3>
In a consulting world, you learn lots of different (technical or not) things. But you never choose which things you're going to learn. Even if this gives you a useful overview of the IT world, it quickly becomes frustrating because you have no time to master something. At best, you can be "pretty good at something", until your client has a whole new problem.

But I think the more experience you get, the more you know what you enjoy doing, and therefore, the less you're satisfied with working on random topics. That's why I still think of consulting as a very good way to start a technical career.

Besides this, the only purpose of being a consultant is to make your client happy. Most of the time, your client doesn't care about good-looking source code, he often doesn't care whether what he's doing is good for the company or not, he cares about making his own superior happy to make his income increase at the end of the year.

Sometimes, as a "simple" consultant, and having to satisfy the client, you're forced to make stupid things like using script shell to create a program that requires object-oriented programming.

That's why I decided to leave the consulting world to focus on programming, probably on my own startup.
<h3><b>The power of programming</b></h3>
I see Programming as a way to create actual value with nothing else than a computer, a brain, and time. I feel very privileged to be able do that. No need for raw materials or financial funding. For someone like me who has always been interested in entrepreneurship, that's just awesome.

My actual motivation about mastering a programming language is the following: I tell myself: "Whatever software ideas I may have, I can realize them". I know it's kind of naive because being able to develop software doesn't mean being able to create a startup.

But there are many different opportunities with being a good developer:

- Having the ability to start the effective development of the idea you get the day before can be very worthwhile if you are interested in software-based start-up development. It prevents you from wasting money on paying consultants the high price, and then postponing the day investors are required.

- If you dream about working abroad, having broadly wanted technical skills is a great way (among others) to be hired in a foreign company.

- Or sometimes, you just want to create something for fun, not for money...because it's a personal challenge, to help someone you like, or because you just need to create stuff to feel happy.

For all those reasons, I decided to focus on learning Python, Django, AngularJS, Ionic, and other stuff that was all fun, useful for my startup project, and valuable on the market at the same time. I learn a lot everyday, and I'm so glad to have the opportunity to choose in which area I can make progress on.
<h3><b>High hopes</b></h3>
I'll conclude on a positive note because things seem to progressively change for Some "Y Generation" founders. They understand the importance of technical profiles in an innovation-based startup, and so, <a href="http://www.guilhembertholet.com/blog/2012/03/12/comment-devenir-une-startup-developpeur-friendly/">do everything they can to attract them in their startup</a>. Plus, the ratio between supply and demand is very favorable to IT professionals, so recruiters need to try new methods to attract/keep them, in addition to raising incomes. Some French IT consulting firms like Octo seem to understand how to make technical guys happy.

What about you? What do you think of the French programming ecosystem?
