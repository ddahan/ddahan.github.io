Why it's often better to do it yourself.

// Almost everything can be learnt.

// What are your motivations? Do you care about learning? doing? Or you just want getting things done, no matter who achieve the tasks?

// Rework

// Limitations

You have to agree with the fact that some tasks require a special talent. Maybe you have it, maybe not.
For example, I'm thinking of graphics skills. It's pretty impossible to draw a logo by yourself if you never did this before.
