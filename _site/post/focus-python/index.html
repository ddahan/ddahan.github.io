Why I chose Python as the language to learn, and why I chose to make a choice about which language to use?

Beaucoup de langages différents, de manière plus ou mons approfondie (C, C++, Java, Caml, Pascal, C#)

Frustration d'en maitriser aucun

1) The language itself: It's really to learn, easy to write and it's easy to read other's code. The syntax is damn clean! There is no braces since code indentation has meaning.
Besides, it supports multiple programming paradigms: object-oriented, imperative and functional.

2) I can do almost everything that I want to with this language : scripting on Unix environments (Python is installed by default), Web-site development (using for instance the awesome Django Framework), thick multi-OS programs with GUI (with TkInter for example), Games (with Pygame), etc.
Even if I know that playing with different languages (I dit it during school with C, C++, Java, Caml, etc..) allows the developer to understand better difficult concepts, in a real world where time is not infinite, I'm convinced that it's more productive to have strong knowledge in Algorithm Analysis then focusing on mastering one versatile language, rather than trying to be the best at all.
