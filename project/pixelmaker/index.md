[Pixelmaker](https://www.pixelmaker.io/) is an Icon-Font-To-PNG-Online-Converter.

It's the successor of [fa2png](http://fa2png.io/) which I build in 2014 with one of my friends [Jannik](http://jannikweyrich.com/).

Since the site receives a constant increase of visitors (not much but more than expected) and some people requested to add new font versions and more features, I decided to build a new version from scratch.

To make this project more flexible and future proof I decided to build everything around a django stack.

It took me about 3 weeks from the first line of code to the first release.
